There was a college fest and there were projects made in physics,chemistry,etc.
I asked the teacher if there was any projects made for computer science.
The teacher asked me if I were intrested in making one....
I said yes... because whenever I'm nervous i take stupid decisions
I made this project in a day and presented it to the teachers
They didn't like it very much and said that they can't add it in the fest because of so and so reason
And they asked me to participate in some euntreprenureship contest and I didnt because this isn't a suitable project for that.
The end!!!!
